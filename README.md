# Space_Invaders
Rudimentary Python3 implementation of Space Invaders. I'm trying to make use of the concept of inheritance, but also OOP in general.

Run using `python3 main.py`.

Might be the case that the clearScreen function in main.py doesn't function on operating systems other than windows.

There's a few TODOs mentioned in files. There's other potential future ideas I had as well:
  - Add more tanks for multiplayer.
  - Make shoot button a different key so one hand shoots, another moves tank.
  - Display explosions (bullet hits weapon) on field making defeat easier to recognize as well.
  - Test if program runs on other operating systems. If not, make it be able to run on other OSes.
  
As it stands, I'm happy with how it looks and runs, even if it does run a little crummily.
